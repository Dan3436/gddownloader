# Geometry Dash Downloader ![AutoHotkey](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-AutoHotkey-green.svg)
**Geometry Dash Downloader** - A script for downloading Newgrounds banned songs.

This is possible due to a known pattern in the audio link:

`https://audio-download.ngfiles.com/(ID - Mod(ID/1000))/(ID)_(Modified name with limit of 26 characters).mp3`

This pattern only works from ID No. 469775 onwards.

After entering the ID and the name of the audio, the download will start and the audio will be saved in the selected path.
